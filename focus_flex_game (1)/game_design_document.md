# Focus Flex Game Design Document

## Game Concept
"Focus Flex" is a web-based cognitive training game designed specifically for gamers to improve three key cognitive skills:
1. Quick attention switching between multiple tasks
2. Maintaining focus amidst visual and cognitive distractions
3. Reaction speed testing and improvement

The game will feature increasing difficulty levels, performance tracking with graphical statistics, and will be optimized for mobile devices while also working well on desktop platforms.

## Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Multi-Task Challenge
Players must monitor and respond to multiple simultaneous tasks that appear in different zones of the screen:

- **Color Match Zone**: Players must tap/click when the color of a central object matches the border color
- **Symbol Track Zone**: Players must tap/click specific symbols in a sequence as they appear among distractors
- **Reaction Zone**: Random stimuli appear that require immediate response (tap/click within a time window)

### 2. Distraction Elements
- Visual distractions (flashing elements, moving objects in peripheral vision)
- Cognitive distractions (math problems or pattern recognition tasks that appear but should be ignored)
- False signals (stimuli that resemble target stimuli but should not be responded to)

### 3. Progression System
- Game sessions last 60-90 seconds
- Difficulty increases based on player performance
- Higher levels introduce more tasks, faster stimuli, and more complex distractions
- Performance score based on accuracy, reaction time, and ability to maintain focus

## User Interface Design

### Mobile-First Layout
- Portrait orientation optimized for one-handed play
- Task zones arranged vertically for easy thumb access
- Large, touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 48x48px)
- High contrast visuals for outdoor visibility

### Game Screen Elements
1. **Score/Performance Display** (top of screen)
   - Current score
   - Combo meter for consecutive correct responses
   - Session timer

2. **Task Zones** (middle of screen)
   - Clearly delineated sections for each task type
   - Visual indicators for active/inactive states
   - Feedback animations for correct/incorrect responses

3. **Controls** (bottom of screen)
   - Pause button
   - Settings access
   - Help/tutorial access

### Statistics Screen
- Session summary showing:
  - Overall score
  - Reaction time graph (average and trend)
  - Accuracy percentage by task type
  - Focus maintenance score
  - Personal bests and improvement trends

## Visual Style
- Clean, minimalist design with high contrast
- Dark mode by default with light mode option
- Neon accent colors for important elements
- Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract
- Cybersport/e-sports aesthetic that appeals to gamers

## Performance Metrics

### Tracked Metrics
1. **Reaction Speed**
   - Average reaction time (milliseconds)
   - Reaction time consistency (standard deviation)
   - Reaction time trends over multiple sessions

2. **Task Switching Efficiency**
   - Time to switch between different task types
   - Accuracy after task switches vs. during sustained tasks

3. **Focus Maintenance**
   - Resistance to distractions (correct responses despite distractions)
   - Sustained attention score (performance over time within session)
   - Error rate during high distraction periods

### Statistics Visualization
- Line graphs for reaction time trends
- Heat maps showing performance by screen zone
- Bar charts comparing performance across different cognitive skills
- Progress charts showing improvement over time/sessions

## Technical Implementation Considerations
- React for frontend development
- Local storage for saving player statistics
- Responsive design using CSS media queries and flexible layouts
- Touch and click event handling
- Performance optimization for smooth animations on mobile devices
- Offline functionality for play without internet connection

## Blogger Integration
- Embeddable via iframe
- Configurable size to fit different blog layouts
- Lightweight loading for minimal impact on blog performance
- Social sharing functionality for scores
